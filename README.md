# toy_exchange_app

Those who have children at home know how much space toys and equipment take up and how quickly children,
as they grow up, quickly change their focus. Soon the house will be a pit of toys and equipment that no one uses anymore…
So the next mobile app idea is to develop a platform where parents could sell their old toys or equipment,
or even swap them with others, and the exchange can be a better idea, because your child will be 
happy with a new toy and won’t be sad to lose the old one (which happens even if he didn’t use it anymore,
parents know what I’m talking about…)
Parents will easily stock old equipment and can save money by avoiding having to buy new ones.
